blurb:
    heading: "Why monitor?"
    text: "Adtest specializes in regular automated marketing advertisements and backlink testing with human confirmation and debugging. We noticed recurring issues in enterprise-level ad consumers that end up wasting money and harming the brand. Mostly cases of paid traffic getting to wrong or non-existent landings consistently for months."
intro:
    heading: "What we offer"
    text: "We offer recurring hourly checks of your ads, marketing or affiliate links and landing pages to make sure the customer journey doesn't suffer from either ad partner or ad manager making changes in the ad platform. We also help to make sure your web developers or content managers don't harm the landing pages or the main CTAs. We offer seamless integration with your Marketing and Analytics to improve the quality of the monitoring."
values:
    heading: "Our mission"
    text: "We aim to optimize ad spendings and reduce the harm done to the brand by notifying the key stakeholders early when their paid customers hit malfunctioning, unrelated or broken pages instead of proper landing pages. Thus, making the world of advertisement a more welcoming and reliable environment."
